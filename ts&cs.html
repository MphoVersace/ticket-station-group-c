        We are an agent for event organisers and we sell and collect money from you on behalf of these event organisers. If you have a problem you need to take it up with the event organiser, not Ster-Kinekor <br>
        
        3. Booking tickets for events offered by third parties <br>
        
        3.1 In this instance Ster-Kinekor merely acts as an agent for the providers, promoters and organisers of events ("event organisers"). Ster-Kinekor sells tickets to you and collects payment from you on behalf of such event organisers. You are buying each ticket from the relevant event organiser and not from Ster-Kinekor. You are therefore contracting with the event organiser and your rights and obligations in relation to the relevant event organiser enforceable against and by such event organiser and not Ster-Kinekor. These terms and conditions are however, enforceable against you and by you. Event organisers may refuse admission to events, alter the program or seating arrangements for events, or even postpone or cancel events in certain circumstances. Ster-Kinekor cannot accept any liability should any of the aforementioned occur. You can, however, call Customer Care on 0861 (MOVIES) 668437 to enquire about any relevant refund or exchange procedures that may apply in these instances. <br>
